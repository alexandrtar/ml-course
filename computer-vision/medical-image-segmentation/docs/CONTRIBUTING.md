Development Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Git

(Optional) CUDA-enabled GPU

Setup Steps
Fork and clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-image-segmentation-unet.git
cd medical-image-segmentation-unet
Create virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .  # Install in development mode
Install development dependencies:

bash
pip install black flake8 pytest pytest-cov pre-commit
Setup pre-commit hooks:

bash
pre-commit install
Coding Standards
Python Code Style
We use Black for code formatting and Flake8 for linting.

bash
# Format code
black medical_image_segmentation tests scripts

# Check linting
flake8 medical_image_segmentation tests scripts

# Run both
pre-commit run --all-files
Documentation Standards
Use Google-style docstrings

Include type hints for function signatures

Update relevant documentation when changing code

Add examples for complex functions

Testing Standards
Write tests for all new functionality

Maintain test coverage above 80%

Use descriptive test method names

Include both unit and integration tests

Branching Strategy
main: Production-ready code

develop: Development branch

feature/*: Feature development

bugfix/*: Bug fixes

release/*: Release preparation

Commit Message Convention
Use descriptive commit messages following this pattern:

text
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
Types:

feat: New feature

fix: Bug fix

docs: Documentation

style: Code style changes

refactor: Code refactoring

test: Test-related changes

chore: Maintenance tasks

Examples:

text
feat(models): add attention UNet architecture
fix(training): resolve memory leak in trainer
docs(api): update inference documentation
Testing
Running Tests
bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_models.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=medical_image_segmentation

# Run with specific marker
pytest -m "slow"  # Run slow tests
Writing Tests
Place tests in tests/ directory

Use descriptive test names

Test both success and failure cases

Use fixtures for common setup

Documentation
Building Documentation
bash
# Install documentation dependencies
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material

# Serve documentation locally
mkdocs serve

# Build documentation
mkdocs build
Documentation Structure
API Reference: Auto-generated from docstrings

User Guide: Tutorials and how-tos

Development Guide: Contributor documentation

Deployment Guide: Production deployment instructions

Release Process
Update version in pyproject.toml and setup.py

Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes

Create release branch from develop

Run full test suite

Merge to main and tag release

Build and publish package to PyPI

Update documentation for new release

Getting Help
Documentation: Check the docs/ directory

Issues: Search and create issues on GitHub

Discussion: Use GitHub Discussions for questions

Email: Contact maintainers directly

Usually these files are written by a python script from a template
before PyInstaller builds the exe, so as to inject date/other infos into it.

pyenv
For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version
pipenv
According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

poetry
Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
commonly ignored for libraries.
https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

pdm
Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock

pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
in version control.

PyCharm
JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file. For a multi-project
setup, it may be better to not include this directory and instead use a per-project
.gitignore to ignore the project's .idea directory.
